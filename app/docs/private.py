to which the survivor belongs:</p>
<code>{'settlement': '59669ace4af5ca799c968c94'}</code>

survivor, so long as they comply with the data model for survivors.</p>
<p> Consult the <a href="/#survivorDataModel">Survivor Data Model (below)</a> for a
complete reference on what attributes of the survivor may be set at
creation time.</p>
<p>As a general piece of advice, it typically makes more sense to
just initialize a new survivor with defaults and then operate on it
using the routes below, unless you're doing something inheritance.</p>
<p>For normal inheritance, simply <b>POST</b> the OID's of one or
more of the survivor's parents like so:</p>
<code>{settlement: '59669ace4af5ca799c968c94', father: '5a341e6e4af5ca16907c2dff'}</code>
<p>...or like so:</p>
<code>{settlement: '59669ace4af5ca799c968c94', father: '5a341e6e4af5ca16907c2dff', mother: '5a3419c64af5ca11240f519f'}</code>
<p>This will cause normal inheritance rules to be triggered when the
new survivor is created.</p>
<p>In order to trigger conditional or special inheritance, e.g. where
an innovation requires the user to select a single parent as the donor,
you <u>must</u> specify which parent is the donor using the <code>
primary_donor_parent</code> key and setting it to 'father' or 'mother':</p>
<code>{settlement: '59669ace4af5ca799c968c94', father: '5a341e6e4af5ca16907c2dff', mother: '5a3419c64af5c
a11240f519f', primary_donor_parent: 'father'}</code>

<p>This will cause innovations such as <b>Family</b> to use the primary
donor parent to follow one-parent inheritance rules for that innovation.</p>
<p>As of API releases > 0.77.n, survivors can be created with an avatar.
Inclde the <code>avatar</code> key in the <b>POST</b> body, and let
that key's value be a string representation of the image that should

<p>Creating new survivors this way is very simple. This JSON, for
