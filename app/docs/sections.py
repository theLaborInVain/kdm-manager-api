settlement's timeline.
<p> Make sure you you are familiar with the data model for the timeline
(documented in the paragraphs below) before using these routes.</p>
<p>At the highest level, every settlement's <code>sheet.timeline</code>
element is a list of hashes, where each hash represents an individual
lantern year.</p>
<p>Within each Lantern Year, the keys's values are lists of events, except
for the <code>year</code> key, which is special because it is the only
key in the Lantern Year hash whose value is an integer, instead of a list.</p>
<p>The other keys in the hash, the ones whose values are lists of events,
have to be one of the following:
<ul class="embedded">
    <li><code>settlement_event</code></li>
    <li><code>story_event</code></li>
    <li><code>special_showdown</code></li>
    <li><code>nemesis_encounter</code></li>
    <li><code>showdown_event</code></li>
</ul>
Individual events are themselves hashes. In the 1.2 revision of the
timeline data model, individual event hashes have a single key/value
pair: they either have a <code>handle</code> key, whose value is an
event handle (e.g. from the settlement JSON's <code>game_assets.events
</code> element) or a a <code>name</code> key, whose value is an
arbitrary string.</p>
<p>In generic terms, here is how a settlement's <code>
sheet.timeline</code> JSON is structured:</p>
                    <pre><code>
[
    {
        year: 0,
        showdown_event: [{name: 'name'}],
        story_event: [{handle: 'handle'}]
    },
    {year: 1, special_showdown: [{name: 'name'}], settlement_event: [{handle: 'handle'}]}
    {year: 2, }
    {year: 3, nemesis_encounter: [{name: 'name'}, {name: 'name'}], story_event: [{name: 'name'}, {handle: 'handle'}]}
    ...
]</code></pre>
<p><b>Important!</b> Individual Lantern Year hashes need not
contain any event list hashes, but they <u>absolutely must contain a
hash with the <code>year</code> key/value pair.</u></p>
<p>Any attempt to <b>POST</b> a Lantern Year without this 'magic'
key/value pair, will cause the API to throw an error.</p>
<p>Also, for now, the API does not enforce any normalization or business logic
for the timeline and individual event lists may contain as many
event hashes as necessary.</p>
<p>Finally, the API should <b>always</b> render the list of Lantern
Year hashes (i.e. <code>sheet.timeline</code> in "chronological"
order. If you get them back out of order, open a ticket.</p>
